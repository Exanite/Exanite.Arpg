# Exanite.Arpg
Exanite.Arpg is a work-in-progress action RPG that is built in the Unity game engine. It is inspired by Path of Exile and a wide variety of other games.

This project as of right now is a solo project and serves as an experiment for me to learn about creating games in Unity and how to use the many features of Git and Github.

# Getting started
The project is currently built with Unity 2019.4.0.

1. Install Unity 2019.4.0 from the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

2. Clone the project 
```
git clone https://github.com/Exanite/Exanite.Arpg.git

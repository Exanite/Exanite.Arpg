# Exanite.Arpg

**Currently not being developed**

Exanite.Arpg is a work-in-progress action RPG that is built in the Unity game engine. It is inspired by Path of Exile and a wide variety of other games.

This project as of right now is a solo project and serves as an experiment for me to learn about creating games in Unity and how to use the many features of Git and Github.

# Exanite.Arpg

Exanite.Arpg is a work-in-progress action RPG that is built in the Unity game engine. It is inspired by Path of Exile and a wide variety of other games.

This project as of right now is a solo project and serves as an experiment for me to learn about creating games in Unity and how to use the many features of Git and Github.

# Contributing

If you really want to contribute, here is how to do so.

The project is currently built with Unity 2019.4.0.

Any Git client can work, but I recommend either using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

1. Install Unity 2019.4.0 from the [Unity Download Archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)

2. Create a [Fork](https://github.com/Exanite/Exanite.Arpg/fork) of the project

3. Clone your fork
```
git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/Exanite.Arpg.git
```
4. Use Unity to open the project

5. Create a new branch (`feature/<YourFeature>` or `fix/<YourFix>`)

6. Make and commit your changes

7. Open a pull request

8. Wait until your pull request is reviewed

Please make sure commit messages, code, and other changes follow this project's existing conventions. (Commits, assets, code, etc)

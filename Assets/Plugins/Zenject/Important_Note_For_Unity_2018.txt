Important Note!

From Extenject 9.0 we started to target Unity 2019 and 2020.

On special request to make this release available for Unity 2018 LTS.
As this release still works 100% with Unity 2018.4 we decided to make this release backwards compatible.

But please do take account of this:
You may expect issues when installing future updates in your Unity 2018 projects.
Which means that maybe you need to uprgrade to a newer Unity version.
